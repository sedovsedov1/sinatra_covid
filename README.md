Hello 

This is my first project. Simple syte for distant education in college from Covid-19
You must have Ruby + gem Sinatra + hosting for work

All information in 3 files:
1) groups.txt (list groups students, example 10,20,30), all new group new line
2) prepods.txt (list prepods with his password, example "Ivanov Ivanov1"), all new prepod new line
3) data.txt (list tasks for students, example "Ivanov|10|Math|Multiply"), all new task new line

Prepods must remember login/password, admin must know current login/password = admin/p@ssw0rd

Have fun!
